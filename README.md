# send-file
Share a file and get an URL quickly.
## Install
This is a node project, so you need to install Node.js at first.
`npm install -g send-file`

!! Since I don't provide any storage service, so you can install a server on your own.

## Get Started
`send-file <filename>`
or just simply use the short alias `send <filename>`

## Install on server
`npm install -g send-file && send-file -s`

>> After you deploy the server side, you need to edit your own file at ~/.send-file.conf
